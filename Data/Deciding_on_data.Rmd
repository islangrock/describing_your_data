Notes for follow-up:

 **All possibly helpful question for class workshopping?** 
 *How to get pageviews? Creation Date?* 

Need page IDs for my sample. Need to make choices about how to sample as I don't think I will be able to download all women in the category "artist" "scientist" and "politician." Although I should figure out how much information this will be.
